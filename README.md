# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Summary
Here is my Social Network API displayed using Insomnia! To start using the code run "npm install" and "npm start"

In the JSON section you need to input first and last names and optionally an email and the users ID will automatically be generated.
Here you can add and remove friends using the respected paths, create, find users, update and delete users.
The same thing can be done with thoughts and reactions.
